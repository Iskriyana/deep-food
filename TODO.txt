[model/data] 1

Creating a new dataset with the images of ingredients using Michi's image_downloader
 Following https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images
 the ingrediesnt can be arranged into directories like
 single_ingredient_pics/
  daisy/
  dandelion/
  roses/
  sunflowers/
  tulips/
 to use the image downloader one should be careful that preferably each image should have one item
 (include one/a/an in the search with the approriate unit (ex: 1 bowl rice)

[model] 2

Ater creaing the datasets one can start training the last layer of the classifier
 and if the performance is not good, start fine-tuning:
 be careful  of points mentioned in https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/
 my_model.model.fit(new_dataset, validation_data=??, epochs=10)
